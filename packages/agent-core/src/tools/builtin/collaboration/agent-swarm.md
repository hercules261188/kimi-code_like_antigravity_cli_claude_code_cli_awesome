Launch multiple subagents from one prompt template and a list of item values.

Use AgentSwarm when many subagents should run the same kind of task over different inputs. The placeholder is exactly `{{item}}`. For example, with `prompt_template` set to `Review {{item}} for likely regressions.` and `items` set to `["src/a.ts", "src/b.ts"]`, AgentSwarm launches two subagents with those two concrete prompts.
