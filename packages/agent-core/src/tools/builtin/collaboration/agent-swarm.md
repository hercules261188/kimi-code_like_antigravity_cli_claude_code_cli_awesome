Launch multiple subagents from one prompt template and a list of item values.

Use AgentSwarm when many subagents should run the same kind of task over different inputs. The placeholder is exactly `{{item}}`. For example, with `prompt_template` set to `Review {{item}} for likely regressions.` and `items` set to `["src/a.ts", "src/b.ts"]`, AgentSwarm launches two subagents with those two concrete prompts.

Use enough subagents to keep the work focused and parallel. AgentSwarm supports up to 128 subagents, and launches are queued automatically, so it is safe to split large tasks into many clear, independent items.
